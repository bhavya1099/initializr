Scenario 1: Test to validate getClient method with IP attribute.

Details:
  TestName: getClientIpAddress
  Description: This test is to validate the behaviour of the getClient and getIp methods within the ClientInformation class. It checks if the correct IP address is returned when configured.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a ProjectRequestDocument instance and set a ClientInformation instance with defining IP address.
  Act: Invoke getIp method via getClient method on the ProjectRequestDocument instance.
  Assert: Check if the asserted value matches the IP address that was set.
Validation:
  The assertion aims to verify if the IP returned by getIp matches the one that was initialized. This ensures data integrity and confirms the client IP details are being correctly stored and retrieved.

Scenario 2: Test to validate getIp method with default returned value.

Details:
  TestName: validateDefaultIpAddressValue
  Description: The test is to verify the default value returned by the getIp method when no IP address details are explicitly provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ClientInformation class without setting an IP value.
  Act: Invoke the getIp method on the ClientInformation instance.
  Assert: Check if the value of IP is null or a predefined default value (based upon the system configuration).
Validation:
  Since no IP was set, getIp should ideally return null or a default value. This scenario ensures that the system behaves predictably even when certain data (here, IP) is not available.

Scenario 3: Test to validate getIp method with invalid ClientInformation object.

Details:
  TestName: testGetIpWhenClientInfoNull
  Description: This test is to ensure the getIp method behaves as expected when the ClientInformation object in ProjectRequestDocument is not initialized.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of the ProjectRequestDocument class without setting the ClientInformation.
  Act: Invoke the getIp method via getClient method on the ProjectRequestDocument instance.
  Assert: Check if a NullPointerException is thrown.
Validation:
  If client information is not set, trying to fetch the client and then trying to get IP from it should throw a NullPointerException. This test ensures that the system handles such null scenarios as expected.

Please note: replace NullPointerException with the specific exception that your system throws in case of null object references.

Please note: As per your system configuration, replace null with the default value that is returned when a particular attribute is not set.,

ROOST_METHOD_HASH=getPatch_ebf92cb367
ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=getPatch_bcc0bee242

Scenario 1: Verifying the correct patch value

Details:
TestName: verifyCorrectPatchValue
Description: The test checks if the method getPatch is returning the correct patch value when it is called.

Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Version object with a specific patch value.
    Act: Call the method getPatch on the created Version object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value equals the specific patch value that was set (in Arrange).

Validation:
    This assertion verifies that the getPatch method is correctly retrieving the value set for the patch. The patch, being a versioning detail, if correct, helps maintain the right order and roll-backs in case of any version-specific issues.


Scenario 2: Null patch value

Details
TestName: validateNullPatchValue
Description: The test ensures correct response when the patch value is null.

Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate a new Version object without setting any patch value.
    Act: Call the method getPatch on the created Version object.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is null.

Validation:
    The assertion checks if the getPatch method correctly handles a null patch value. This validation is critical as it ensures the getPatch method does not break and appropriately handles null values.


Scenario 3: Minor and Major values don't affect patch

Details:
TestName: verifyPatchValueIndependent
Description: The test checks if changing values of major and minor versions does not affect the patch version.

Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate two Version objects with the same patch value but different major and minor values.
    Act: Call the method getPatch on both Version objects.
    Assert: Assert that the returned value is the same from both the objects.

Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the patch value is independent of major and minor versions. This is vital for maintaining correct versioning hierarchy.

Scenario 4: Duplicate patch values comparisons

Details:
TestName: validateDuplicatePatchValues
Description: The test checks if multiple Version objects with the same patch value are considered equal when using getPatch.

Execution:
    Arrange: Instantiate two Version objects with the same patch value.
    Act: Call the method getPatch on both Version objects.
    Assert: Assert that the returned values from calling getPatch on each Version object are equal.

Validation:
    This assertion verifies that objects having the same patch value should have identical results from the getPatch method. This ensures that versioning consistency is maintained across multiple instances.

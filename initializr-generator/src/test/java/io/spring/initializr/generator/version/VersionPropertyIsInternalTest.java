Scenario 1: Testing IsInternal Method When Internal Property is True
  Details:
    TestName: isInternalWhenInternalTrue
    Description: This test ensures that the isInternal method returns a true value when the 'internal' property is true. Ensures that the 'isInternal' method perfectly reflects the state of the 'internal' property.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the VersionProperty object with the 'internal' property set as true.
    Act: Invoke the isInternal method of the VersionProperty instance.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the function call is true.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the 'isInternal' method properly represents the state of the 'internal' property, namely true in this case. This is significant because it confirms that properties of the VersionProperty object are accurately returned by their respective getter methods.

Scenario 2: Testing IsInternal Method When Internal Property is False
  Details:
    TestName: isInternalWhenInternalFalse
    Description: This test ensures that the isInternal method returns a false value when the 'internal' property is false. It verifies that the 'isInternal' method accurately reflects the state of the 'internal' property.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the VersionProperty object with the 'internal' property set as false.
    Act: Invoke the isInternal method of the VersionProperty instance.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the function call is false.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the 'isInternal' method properly reflects the state of the 'internal' property, namely false in this case. This is significant because it confirms that the properties of the VersionProperty object are accurately returned by their respective getter methods.

Scenario 3: Testing IsInternal Method for Validation in Comparison with Other Methods
  Details:
    TestName: isInternalValidationInComparisonWithOtherMethods
    Description: This test uses other public methods in the class to change the 'internal' property, then verifies the correct result is returned. It ensures the 'isInternal' method is not affected by the use of other methods.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of the VersionProperty object. Perform operations using other public methods (except the equals and compareTo method as it won't change the object state).
    Act: Invoke the isInternal method of the VersionProperty instance.
    Assert: Assert that the result of the function call matches the 'internal' state as expected.
  Validation:
    The assertion verifies that the 'isInternal' method accurately reflects the 'internal' state even after operations are performed using other methods. This is significant because it ensures the integrity of the method across different operations on the object.,

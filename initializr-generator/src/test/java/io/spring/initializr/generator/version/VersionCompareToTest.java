Scenario 1: Null Comparison
  Details:
    TestName: compareToWithNull.
    Description: This tests the compareTo method when null is passed as the parameter.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create a version.
    Act: Call compareTo method with null as the parameter.
    Assert: Expect the returned output to be 1.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the compareTo method correctly handles null input. This is expected since as mentioned in the business logic, if the compared version is null, the current version is considered greater (returns 1).

Scenario 2: Major Version Comparison
  Details:
    TestName: compareToWithDifferentMajors.
    Description: This tests the compareTo method when the versions have different major numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two versions with different major, and same minor numbers, patch versions and qualifier.
    Act: Call compareTo method passing the second version as the parameter.
    Assert: Check if the returned output suits the expected outcome based on the comparison of major versions.
  Validation:
    This test validates the correctness of the comparison of major versions by the compareTo method. It reflects the business functionality that compares major version numbers first.

Scenario 3: Minor Version Comparison
  Details:
    TestName: compareToWithDifferentMinors.
    Description: This tests the compareTo method when the versions have same major, and different minor numbers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two versions with same major, and different minor numbers, same patch versions and qualifier.
    Act: Call compareTo method passing the second version as the parameter.
    Assert: Check if the returned output suits the expected outcome based on the comparison of minor versions.
  Validation:
    This test validates that the compareTo method correctly compares minor versions when major versions are equal.

Scenario 4: Patch Version Comparison
  Details:
    TestName: compareToWithDifferentPatchVersions.
    Description: This tests the compareTo method when the versions have same major and minor numbers, but different patch versions.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two versions with same major and minor numbers, but different patch versions and same qualifier.
    Act: Call compareTo method passing the second version as the parameter.
    Assert: Check if the returned output suits the expected outcome based on the comparison of patch versions.
  Validation:
    The compareTo method's correctness in comparing patch versions when major and minor versions are equal is validated by this test.

Scenario 5: Qualifier Comparison
  Details:
    TestName: compareToWithDifferentQualifiers.
    Description: This tests the compareTo method when the versions have same major, minor and patch numbers, but different qualifiers.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two versions with same major, minor and patch numbers, but different qualifiers.
    Act: Call compareTo method passing the second version as the parameter.
    Assert: Check if the returned output suits the expected outcome based on the comparison of qualifiers.
  Validation:
    This test validates the correctness of the compareTo method in comparing qualifiers, when major, minor and patch versions are equal.

Scenario 6: Equal Versions Comparison.
  Details:
    TestName: compareToWithEqualVersions.
    Description: This tests the compareTo method when the versions being compared are exactly the same.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two identical versions.
    Act: Call compareTo method passing the second version as the parameter.
    Assert: Expect the returned output to be 0.
  Validation:
    This test validates the correctness of the compareTo method when comparing exactly similar versions. The expected behaviour is to return 0, indicating both versions are equal.

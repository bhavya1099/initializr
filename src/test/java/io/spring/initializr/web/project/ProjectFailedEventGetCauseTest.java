Scenario 1: Test to check the getCause method returns the Exception object

TestName: checkGetCauseMethodReturnsExceptionObject
Description: This test is designed to verify that the getCause() method returns the correct Exception object that has been set as the cause.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ProjectFailedEvent and set a known Exception as a value for the cause.
  Act: Call the getCause() method on the created instance of ProjectFailedEvent.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from the getCause() method matches the known Exception value.
Validation:
  The assertion validates that the getCause() method correctly returns the exception object that was set for cause. This is important for troubleshooting failed events as it gives insights into what exception was responsible for the failure.

Scenario 2: Test to verify the getCause method returns null when no exceptions were set

TestName: checkGetCauseReturnsNullForNoExceptionSet
Description: This test ensures that the getCause() method returns null when no exceptions have been set.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ProjectFailedEvent without setting an Exception for the cause.
  Act: Call the getCause() method on the ProjectFailedEvent instance.
  Assert: Assert that the returned value from getCause() is null.
Validation:
  This test validates that the getCause() method returns null when no Exception was set, thus maintaining program stability and data integrity. This is crucial as it might be expected that no exception exists if no explicit exception was applied.

Scenario 3: Test to ensure getCause method returns the right type

TestName: ensureGetCauseReturnsRightType
Description: This test verifies that the getCause() method returns an instance of the type Exception.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create an instance of ProjectFailedEvent and set a known Exception as a value for the cause.
  Act: Call the getCause() method on the created instance of ProjectFailedEvent.
  Assert: Assert that the returned object from the getCause() call is an instance of Exception.
Validation:
  This test validates that the getCause() method always returns an object of the type Exception. This is crucial during error handling and exception propagation to ensure type consistency.

Please remember that these tests are subject to the availability of certain preconditions or performable actions, like the possibility of setting the instance variable "cause". Without the ability to modify the cause, these tests can't be performed.

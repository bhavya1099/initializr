"Scenario 1: Testing the correct return of the getTimestamp method.

Details:
  TestName: validateReturnedTimestamp
  Description: This test is designed to verify that the getTimestamp method is returning the correct timestamp stored in the timestamp field.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new ProjectRequestEvent object, making note of the timestamp at object creation.
  Act: Invoke the getTimestamp() method on the newly created object.
  Assert: Compare the output of the getTimestamp method with the reference timestamp noted at object creation.
Validation:
  This assertion seeks to ensure that the getTimestamp method is functioning as expected. If the timestamps match, it supports the validation of the method and business logic related to timestamp management.

Scenario 2: Null case for the getTimestamp method.

Details:
  TestName: nullTimestampCheck
  Description: The intention of this test is to verify that even when the object's timestamp is null, the getTimestamp method doesn't cause any unexpected exceptions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new ProjectRequestEvent object, explicitly setting the timestamp to null.
  Act: Call the getTimestamp () method on the newly created object.
  Assert: Assert That an exception does not occur.
Validation:
  This test checks the robustness of the getTimestamp method when prompted to fetch a null timestamp, which could represent a real-world scenario if the timestamp were not correctly initialized for an event. It validates the system's reliability and its error handling capabilities.

Scenario 3: Testing the immutability of the timestamp field.

Details:
  TestName: testTimestampImmutability
  Description: This test is to validate that the timestamp field remains consistent and immutable after object creation, regardless of any changes made in the system in-between method calls.
Execution:
  Arrange: Instantiate a new ProjectRequestEvent object and call getTimestamp() method. Note down returned value.
  Act: Call getTimestamp() method after some delay and record this timestamp.
  Assert: The saved timestamp and the recent timestamp should be the same.
Validation:
  This assertion tests the immutability of the timestamp property, which must remain consistent to ensure the accuracy of event timing data. This test is particularly important in multithreaded environments, where timestamps must remain consistent across all threads.

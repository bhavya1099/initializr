"""
Scenario 1: Comparing a Null Version object

Details:
  TestName: compareWithNullVersion
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly handles a null version object and defaults the comparison result to 1.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Version instance with arbitrary values.
  Act: Call compareTo with a null Version object.
  Assert: Check if the result is 1.
Validation:
  Comparing with a null Version should always yield 1. This is important as it allows the sorting mechanism to handle null values.

Scenario 2: Comparing the Same Version Instance

Details:
  TestName: compareWithSameInstance
  Description: This test check if the method correctly detects the same Version instance.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a Version instance with arbitrary values.
  Act: Call compareTo with the same instance.
  Assert: Check if the result is 0.
Validation:
  Comparing the same instance should always yield 0, indicating that they are equal. This test verifies the Version class's capability to identify identical instances.

Scenario 3: Comparing Versions with Different Major Values

Details:
  TestName: compareVersionsWithDifferentMajorValues
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly compares versions with different major versions.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Version instances with different major values.
  Act: Call compareTo with the second instance.
  Assert: Check if the result is -1 or 1 based on the major versions.
Validation:
  The compareTo method should prioritize major differences and yield a correct result based on the major value. This is crucial as the major number often indicates substantial differences in versions.

Scenario 4: Comparing Versions with Different Minor Versions

Details:
  TestName: compareVersionsWithDifferentMinorValues
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly compares versions with different minor versions when the major versions are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Version instances with the same major values and different minor values.
  Act: Call compareTo with the second instance.
  Assert: Check if the result is -1 or 1 based on the minor versions.
Validation:
  When the major versions are identical, the compareTo method should correctly prioritize the minor versions. This verifies that the Version class can accurately perform comparisons when only minor versions vary.

Scenario 5: Comparing Versions with Different Patches

Details:
  TestName: compareVersionsWithDifferentPatches
  Description: This test checks whether the method correctly compares versions with different patches when major and minor values are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Version instances with the same major and minor values but different patches.
  Act: Call compareTo with the second instance.
  Assert: Check if the result is -1 or 1 based on the patches.
Validation:
  When the major and minor versions are identical, the compareTo method should prioritize the patch differences. This is crucial to ensure accurate version sorting even when differences are subtle.

Scenario 6: Comparing Versions with Different Qualifiers

Details:
  TestName: compareVersionsWithDifferentQualifiers
  Description: This test checks if the method correctly compares versions with different qualifiers when major, minor, and patch values are the same.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create two Version instances with the same major, minor, and patch values but different qualifiers.
  Act: Call compareTo with the second instance.
  Assert: Check if the result is -1 or 1 based on the qualifiers.
Validation:
  When the major, minor, and patch versions are the same, the compareTo method should consider the qualifier. This is vital for ensuring accurate version sorting when all numeric components are the same but qualifiers vary.

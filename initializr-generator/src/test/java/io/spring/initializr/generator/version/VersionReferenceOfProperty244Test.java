Scenario 1: Successfully creating a VersionReference instance through a valid internal property
TestName: testCreationViaValidInternalProperty
Description: This test aims to validate the successful creation of a VersionReference instance when a valid internal property is passed onto the method.
Execution:
  Arrange: A string of property needs to be created.
  Act: Invoke the ofProperty method with the created string property.
  Assert: Assert that the returned VersionReference instance is not null and isProperty method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion checks if the method has successfully created a VersionReference instance. According to the business logic of VersionReference, the ofProperty method is intended to return a new VersionReference instance.

Scenario 2: Handling null internal property
TestName: testCreationWithNullInternalProperty
Description: This test is aimed to validate how the method handles a null input, a usual edge case.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set the internalProperty as null.
  Act: Invoke the ofProperty method with null as a parameter.
  Assert: Assert that the returned VersionReference instance is not null and isProperty method returns false.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the method can handle null cases. If a null input is provided, the method should still return a new VersionReference instance, but isProperty method would return false.

Scenario 3: Creating a VersionReference instance with a complex internal property
TestName: testCreationWithComplexInternalProperty
Description: This test is designed to check how the method responds to a complex internal property string.
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string variable internalProperty with various special characters and numeric values.
  Act: Invoke the ofProperty method with the created string as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the returned VersionReference instance is not null.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies the method's ability to handle complex cases. According to the business logic of VersionReference, the ofProperty method should be able to process any string value and return a new VersionReference instance.

Scenario 4: Using an internal property which already exists as a VersionProperty
TestName: testCreationWithExistingVersionProperty
Description: This test is aimed to verify that the method can handle cases where the input internalProperty has already been defined as a VersionProperty
Execution:
  Arrange: Define a string variable which already exists as a VersionProperty.
  Act: Call the ofProperty method with the predefined VersionProperty string as an argument.
  Assert: Assert that the returned VersionReference instance is not null and isProperty method returns true.
Validation:
  The assertion verifies if the method works correctly when a predefined VersionProperty is used. According to the business logic of VersionReference, the method should return a VersionReference instance even if the provided internalProperty string already exists as a VersionProperty.

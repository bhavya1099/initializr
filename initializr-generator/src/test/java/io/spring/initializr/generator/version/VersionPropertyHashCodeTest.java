"""
Scenario 1: Test to validate hashcode when identical values are given

Details:
  TestName: testHashcodeWhenIdenticalValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct generation of hashcode for the instance of VersionProperty by using similar properties and internal state. The purpose is to verify if hashcode is consistent on multiple invocations for the same object state.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two instances of VersionProperty with same property and internal state.
    Act: Invoke hashCode method on both instances.
    Assert: Check the generated hashcode of both instances to see if they are equal.
  Validation: Hashcodes generated should be equal, as the state of both objects is identical. Since a correct implementation of hashCode needs to provide equal hashcodes for equal objects according to the Java contract, the function applied should give the same result each time on same values.

Scenario 2: Test to validate hashcode when different values are given

Details:
  TestName: testHashcodeWhenDifferentValues
  Description: This test is meant to check the correct generation of hashcode for the instance of VersionProperty by using different properties and internal state. The purpose is to verify if hashcodes are different for distinct objects.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create two instances of VersionProperty with different properties and internal state.
    Act: Invoke hashCode method on both instances.
    Assert: Check if the generated hash code of both instances are not equal.
  Validation: Hashcodes generated should not be equal, as states of both objects are different. It checks the proper functioning of hashCode that should return different hashcodes for non-equal objects most of the time.

Scenario 3: Test to validate hashcode after altering state of object

Details:
  TestName: testHashcodeAfterAlteringState
  Description: This test is meant to check if the hashcode changes after altering the state of the VersionProperty object.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Create an instance of VersionProperty.
    Act: First, Invoke hashCode method on the instance and then change the state of the instance. Again, invoke the hashCode method.
    Assert: Check if the generated hash codes before and after altering state of the instance are not equal.
  Validation: Hashcodes generated before and after altering the state of the instance should not be equal as the hashCode for an object must change if any information used in equals comparisons is altered. This to guarantee that equal objects remain equal throughout their lifespan.

Note: The third scenario will require the values of the fields "property, internal" to be mutable. If these values cannot change, this scenario cannot be tested.
